[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/sgentle/chef-node.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/certara-jgitlin/chef-node)

A simple [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) client for Node.js. Handles the
authentication so you can get on with Cheffing.

Works with Cinc Server as well as Chef Server.

## Install

    npm install chef

## Changes in 1.0.0

Starting with major version 1.x, this module has been taken over by [Josh Gitlin](https://github.com/certara-jgitlin).

The code has been modernized which has a number of breaking changes: The old `request` module is no longer used,
and the Chef client **now uses Promises instead of callbacks**. That means that if you were on a `0.x` version
previously, you will need to re-write your code when moving to 1.0.0 or later.

Previously, `client.put`, `client.get`, etc took a callback as the final argument. Now, they return a promise
which you can chain on to with `client.get(...).then(function (result){ /* callback here */ })`

## Examples

Add role `bar` to node `foo`'s run list.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs'),
    chef = require('chef'),
    key = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/key.file.pem'),
    client = chef.createClient('username', key, 'http://chef.server.com:4000', '12.8.0');

client.get('/nodes/foo').then(node => {
    node.run_list.push('role[bar]');
    client.put('/nodes/foo', node).catch(err => {
        console.error(err);
    });
}).catch(err => { console.error(err); });
```

## Methods

The `client` object supports `delete`, `get`, `post` and `put` methods
and accepts relative and absolute URLs (so you can use URLs returned in
responses.) All methods return a Promise which resolves with the 
deserialized JSON from the Chef server.

The `client` object also supports the `req` method, which supports
passing an arbitrary HTTP verb and HTTP connection options. Unlike
the methods above, `req` returns an object containing the deserialized
JSON along with the actual `req` and `res` objects and associated
metadata (in case you need to access the HTTP status code or other
underlying properties)

## Self Signed Certs

If you need to connect to a chef server with a self signed cert, add the following to the .js file

    process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"
